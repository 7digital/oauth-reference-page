A HTML page that computes an OAuth 1.0 signature, showing all the workings so you can debug your own implementation.

## POST Support

It supports POSTs in the form of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, as well as POSTs of `application/xml` and `application/json` using the `Authorization` header - just put the XML or JSON into the 'body' field and set the 'body encoding' accordingly.

## Developers - OUTDATED

The page is hosted on Github Pages, so be sure to merge your changes into the `gh-pages` branch to see them.

The JavaScript is generated from the PogoScript files. Once you have [installed PogoScript](https://github.com/featurist/pogoscript), just:

	pogo -cw *.pogo

### Testing - OUTDATED

Tests are written using [Zombie.js](https://github.com/assaf/zombie) and [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/).
