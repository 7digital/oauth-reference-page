# OAuth 1.0 Reference Page

A HTML page that computes an OAuth 1.0 signature, showing all the workings so you can debug your own implementation.

## POST Support

It supports POSTs in the form of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, as well as POSTs of `application/xml` and `application/json` using the `Authorization` header - just put the XML or JSON into the 'body' field and set the 'body encoding' accordingly.

If you're using POST or PUT, it's best to copy the curl command output into a terminal window
